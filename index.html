                        <li>...and a load balancer distributes the incoming traffic to those servers</li>
                        <li>initially, the shop took care of everything, presentation of product lists, product detail pages, displaying search results and of course the checkout</li>
                        <li>Now, OXID itself has a very naive implementation when it comes to searching across your products...</li>

                        <li>...so, this is how our product development came to life.</li>
                        <li>With Makaira, we import the product data into an ElasticSearch</li>
                        <li>Not only does this offer a nice performance event at a point where searching becomes slow and inefficient on a relational database like MySQL...</li>

                        <li>Therefore, Makaira adds an additonal layer of to our architecture with ElasticSearch backing all the search and filter functionalities</li>
                        <li>So, after have done all this, we were thinking "since we had to import all the product and category data of the shop system anyway, what else can we do use that for?"</li>

                        <li>in the past couple of years there has been more and more talk about the term "Headless"</li>
                        <li>as to my experience, in the beginning when people were talking about "headless" it was mostly related to content management systems</li>
                        <li>now, with all the data that we need to present the products of a shop, we decided to replace the frontend that OXID with a decoupled application</li>
                        <li>this application gets its data directly out of ElasticSearch and only uses to the shop system for state managemt</li>

                        <li>Since the goal is that this concept should be applicable to any kind of shop, not just this one customer, we wanted to implement the new frontend with an "API-first approach"</li>

                        <li>Since we implemented the new application with Next.js we thought it would be a good idea to couple the implementation with a Pattern Library</li>
                        <li>After all, Next.js is just a supercharged React application...</li>
                        <li>...and React is all about components</li>
                        <li>Should be easy enough, don't you think?</li>
                        <li>Weeeell....it turns out that's not necessary the case.</li>
                        <li>Since we did not have any experience in this area at all, we had to try a couple of different ways on how we could make a pattern library work well our Next.js application</li>
                        <li>The main trouble in the beginning was that we tried to implement both of them as a Mono-Repository...</li>
                        <li>...because after all, we wanted to use the components of our pattern library straigth in the Next.js application</li>
                        <li>It turns out: This worked fine for the components themselves, but we had a lot of trouble when it came to other aspects like where to store assets like stylesheets or images</li>
                        <li>The reason for this is that Next.js can only serve assets located in the "static" directory of Next.js...</li>
                        <li>...and just like Next.js has constraints like this, other frameworks - in our case the pattern library - have similar constraints...</li>
                        <li>...so trying to use them together in a Mono-Repository did not really work out for us</li>
                        <li>After a couple of iterations we landed on a solution that is simply 2 separate repositoies with a custom build process in the case of the pattern library that compiles all the components and packages them together with static assets....</li>
                        <li>...this way we can just use this output in our Next.js application in a fairly painful way</li>

                        <li>So, the job I'm currently working in is my first actual job after the university</li>
                        <li>Why am I telling you this?</li>
                        <li>Since this is my first job I don't have alot of depp knowledge in many of the programming languages on the web because we mainly rely on PHP and JavaScript</li>
                        <li>When I wanted to migrate this specific functionality of the "old" application it proved difficult to replicate the handling for those array values in the query params</li>
                        <li>So for my research, I did not find any mention about some kind of "standard" when it comes to handling these exmaples of nested query params</li>
                        <li>It actually feels like PHP somehow pushed this into web as some kind ofunofficial standard and frameworks that came after had to roll their own implementation to support this syntax</li>
                        <li>I wanted to mention this point because it was actually new and surprising to me</li>
                        <li>So, how did we solve this issue?</li>
                        <li>of course, you could use your own implementation to parse the URL params in Javascript, we solved this by using a small library called "qs"</li>
                        <li>Now, I want to note that I might have been missing something here during my researchand there might actually be way to handle these cases with node.js and express, so if i did - please come to me afterwards, but for now we have a solution that works pretty well for us</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>in the past I never really paid attention to the version of the packages I was using as long as they get the job done</li>
                        <li>building our application made me realize for the first time how you can hit a wall if you are not careful about the libraries you use</li>
                        <li>we were using a next.js-adaption of a popular React-I18n library</li>
                        <li>the package was still pre version 1.0 and changing quite rapidly</li>
                        <li>this caused us to experience 2 breaking changes, one of which we couldn't even debug properly because it only appeared in production and was not reproducable in any way on our local or staging machines</li>
                        <li>in the end we decided it was not worth the trouble and developed our own application</li>
                        <li>the result might not be as sophisticated compared to all the features the library offered</li>
                        <li>in fact, its quite a simple solution</li>
                        <li>but it works perfectly for us with a relativly low compexity and we have one less dependency to maintain</li>
